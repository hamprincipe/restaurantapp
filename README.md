<br>Greetings and welcome to my Full-Stack Restaurant Application github repo.

Instructions:
<li>In order to follow along, you can clone this repo</li>
<li>run "npm install" (to install the dependencies) then "npm run dev" on the main directory</li>
<li>move to the "backend" directory and</li>
<li>run "npm install" (to install the dependencies)</li>
<li>"npm run build"</li>
<li>"npm run develop"</li>

<br>The interface for the restaurant app is pretty simple so you can register for a new account or login if you are already registered. From there, you can add(+) or subtract(-) the number of items you want to add to your cart. When you're finished, hit the "order" button where you can put in your card info and it will get processed through Stripe.

<br>Enjoy!
